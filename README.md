# Time-Series-Prediction-of-Dynamical-Systems
In this project we use several
techniques such as deep-learning, Fourier
transformation, linear regression to
predict the ship trajectory. Lot of
extensive experimental work is done to
acquire the optimal model for this work.
However, to achieve a good accuracy we
used computationally extensive method
which can be optimized in future work.
The result shows success of the predictive
model in several data at different sea state
condition.
